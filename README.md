This is a simple todo app which is developed in flutter and dart.

## About

In this simple app user can add new todo. when he clicked on floating action button a new bottomModelSheet pop up which has form for user interaction. This form also have validation. He/She can delete any completed todo by just clicking on done icon button on the right side of each todo card. Now I also added some new functionality like user can see pending and completed todos on different screens by using popupmenu button widget. I also added some user interactions using snackbar widget. User can undo newly added todo. He can undo newly added completed todo. You can also see that in action by just clonning that project.
